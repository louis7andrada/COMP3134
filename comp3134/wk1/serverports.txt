1. Definition of Server Port: A server port is a virtual point of connection in a network. It allows different applications or processes on a server to share the network's physical resources without interfering with each other. Technically, it is identified by a port number, which is associated with a specific process or a type of network service.

2. Server Port Range: Server ports are identified by numbers ranging from 0 to 65535. This range is divided into different categories:

3. Well-known ports (0-1023)
Registered ports (1024-49151)
Dynamic or private ports (49152-65535)
Bits Represented by Port Numbers: Since the port numbers range from 0 to 65535, they can be represented by a 16-bit number. Each bit can be either 0 or 1, allowing for 2^16 (65536) different combinations.
